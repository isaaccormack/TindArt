[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-team-3-1.svg?token=MKYirfVTx6By2GhqMnsq&branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-team-3-1)
## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-team-3-1.git
```
2. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
3. Compile the Typescript
```sh
npm run build-ts
```
or Compile using Watch Mode:
```sh
npm run watch-ts
```
4. Start the application
```sh
npm start
```
5. Navigate to the site on http://localhost:3000/

## Developing
For ease of development, using services which continuously reflect source code changes is recommended to be used. This can be accomplished by running two proccess continously during development:
1. Typescript transpiler on watch mode to transpile typescript source code into javascript on every save.
2. A 'nodemon' to watch the for changes in the javascript source code and automatically refresh the server to use this code.

To run this while developing, first start the transpiler on watch mode:
```
npm run watch-ts
```
Then, in a new window in your terminal, start the nodemon (an npm script is provided for convenience):
```
npm run dev
```

## Contributing
This app uses [git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching. 
To contribute:
1. Clone the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature)
3. Commit your Changes (git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'). If you don't want the CI pipeline to be re-run on your commit (for example, if you've only changed the docs), then add [skip ci] somewhere in the commit message.
4. Push to the Branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature)
5. Open a Pull Request
