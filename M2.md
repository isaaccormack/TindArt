# Milestone 2 - Detailed Design

<-- Describe, in <5 pages, how you intend to solve the problem and implement user stories and the ASRs from M1. -->
<-- Include how you will continuously integrate and deploy the app and how you will test it. -->
<-- Since we know this is a web app, assume the reader is familiar with basic app design and -->
<-- instead elaborate on how you will make the app conform to the ASRs (e.g., ensure performance is satisfied). -->

<-- DELIVERABLES -->
<-- * PlantUML or JetUML class and behavior diagrams. --> 
<--   This should explain the module structure and runtime/C&C structure of your app. -->
<-- * Design rationale, as Arch Decision Record -->
